## About

If you're enjoying this mod, and want to support me, you can [buy me a coffee here](https://ko-fi.com/xiaoxiao921).

## Manual Installation

- Place the main UnchainedTogether file, called `d3d12.dll`, next to the game executable called `ChainedTogether-Win64-Shipping.exe` in the game's `ChainedTogether\Binaries\Win64` folder.

- Launch the game using the DirectX 12 option.

- To uninstall the mod loader or revert to a vanilla experience without mods, you can simply rename or delete the `d3d12.dll` file.

## User Interface

- UnchainedTogether comes with an ImGui user interface. The default key to open the user interface is `INSERT`. You can change this key in the `ReturnOfModding/config/UnchainedTogether-UnchainedTogether-Hotkeys.cfg` file. If the file isn't there, it will appear once you've launched the game at least once with UnchainedTogether installed. There's also a small onboarding window that will appear in-game if the mod loader has launched successfully, where you can also edit the keybind.
